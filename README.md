# Amazon QuickSight Project  

##  Project Title  
**From College Boards to Dashboards: Providing Data Insights to a Community College**  

In this project we  leverage **Amazon QuickSight** to transform raw institutional data into meaningful insights for a community college. The primary goal is to create **interactive dashboards** that track student demographics, enrollment, courses, and faculty evaluations‚Äîhelping administrators, professors, and stakeholders make informed decisions.

## üìÇ Project Structure  

### 1. Dataset Field Name  
A detailed schema defining all dataset fields used in QuickSight. This includes attributes related to students, courses, professors, and enrollment.  

### 2. Dataset Refresh Schedule  
Automated refresh schedules ensure that dashboards reflect the **latest data**. Datasets are configured to update periodically, reducing manual intervention and keeping analytics real-time.  

### 3. Student Type Calculated Field  
Custom QuickSight calculated fields categorize students (e.g., **full-time, part-time, transfer**) to better segment and analyze enrollment trends.  

### 4. Student Majors By Year  
Visualizations break down the number of students in each **major**, grouped by academic year, helping track trends in subject popularity and growth areas.  

### 5. Student Body Overview  
A high-level overview of the **entire student body**, including demographic breakdowns, retention rates, and total enrollment numbers.  

### 6. Custom Topic Fields  
Domain-specific fields are created to simplify queries and improve dashboard usability. These enhance QuickSight‚Äôs **Q & NLP features**, allowing natural language questions.  

### 7. Named Entity: Student Details  
Defines structured attributes for student-related entities‚Äîcovering age, academic year, enrollment type, and performance metrics.  

### 8. Named Entity: Course Details  
Maps course-level details, including course codes, credits, departments, and enrollment statistics.  

### 9. Named Entity: Professor Evaluation  
Captures evaluation scores and feedback for professors, enabling analysis of **teaching effectiveness** and faculty development needs.  

### 10. Verified Answers List  
Repository of validated answers for predefined queries, ensuring consistent responses across stakeholders using QuickSight Q.  

### 11. Student Enrolment Dashboard  
An interactive dashboard displaying:  
- Enrollment by program, year, and type  
- Trends over multiple semesters  
- Key metrics on student intake and dropout rates  

### 12. Started Complex Question  
A section dedicated to advanced QuickSight Q queries, showcasing how complex business questions can be answered directly using natural language.  

### 13. Scenario Follow Up Thread  
Tracks scenario-based Q&A sessions with follow-up queries, including:  
- **Q1 ‚Üí Response**  
- **Q2 ‚Üí Response**  
- **Q3 ‚Üí Response**  
- **Q4 ‚Üí Response**  
- **Q5: Scatter Plot Visualization** for correlation analysis  

### 14. Data Story  
A storytelling layer that transforms dashboards into **narrative insights**, helping non-technical users understand the implications of the data.  

### 15. Dataset Listing  
A structured index of all datasets imported into QuickSight, including student records, course catalogs, and faculty evaluations.  

### 16. Analyses Listing  
Comprehensive list of all **analyses** created from datasets, forming the foundation of dashboards and stories.  

### 17. Dashboard Listing  
Index of dashboards designed for stakeholders (administrators, faculty, students), tailored to their specific needs.  

### 18. Topics Listings  
Predefined QuickSight **Q topics**, enabling users to ask natural language questions like *‚ÄúHow many students enrolled in Computer Science in 2023?‚Äù*  

### 19. Scenario Listings  
Collection of **scenario-driven analyses**, useful for simulating institutional changes such as shifts in enrollment or course demand.
